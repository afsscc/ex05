          <h2>An eleven chapter short-story</h2>
          <p>
            David Fincher, in full David Leo Fincher, (born August 28, 1962,
            Denver, Colorado, U.S.), American music video and film director
            known for his stylish movies, which usually trended toward the dark
            and atmospheric.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fincher was raised in San Anselmo, California, where he became
            interested in movies at a young age, in part because he was a
            neighbour of filmmaker George Lucas. Fincher was still a teenager
            when he became an assistant cameraman at Industrial Light & Magic,
            Lucas’s special-effects studio.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the mid-1980s Fincher began directing commercials, which quickly
            led to a successful career as a music video director. He made some
            of the most iconic music videos of the 1980s and ’90s—including
            those for Madonna’s “Express Yourself” (1989) and “Vogue” (1990), as
            well as Aerosmith’s “Janie’s Got a Gun” (1989)—which were noted for
            their pronounced cinematic qualities, such as elaborate sets and
            deft camerawork.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1992 Fincher made his feature-film directorial debut with Alien
            3. The movie had a troubled production, and it did poorly both
            critically and commercially. The experience soured Fincher on
            big-budget film franchises, and his next movie was the relatively
            small-scale thriller Se7en (1995), which revolves around two
            detectives (played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) searching for a
            serial killer (played by Kevin Spacey) who bases his murders on the
            seven deadly sins. The moody Se7en earned positive reviews and was a
            box-office success, establishing Fincher as an up-and-coming
            director in Hollywood circles.
          </p>
          <p>
            He then made The Game (1997), in which a financier (Michael Douglas)
            gets caught up in a dangerous game of cat and mouse after receiving
            a mysterious birthday present from his wayward brother (Sean Penn).
          </p>
          <p>
            A perfectionist behind the camera, Fincher became known for his
            proclivity to shoot a scene numerous times—sometimes more than 50
            takes even for a relatively minor shot. His demanding nature
            resulted in films with great visual flair, including his 1999 work,
            Fight Club (starring Pitt and Edward Norton), which centres on a
            disaffected white-collar worker who establishes a series of
            underground fighting organizations. That film doubles as a sardonic
            exploration of self-identity and masculinity. A box-office
            disappointment in its theatrical run, Fight Club became a cult
            sensation on home video, where it developed a devoted following.
            Fincher then made Panic Room (2002), the tale of a mother (Jodie
            Foster) and daughter (Kristen Stewart) who fight off a harrowing
            home invasion.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was five years until Fincher’s next feature film, Zodiac (2007),
            which recounted the murders of the Zodiac killer and the ultimately
            futile attempt to capture him. A marked departure from his previous
            films, Zodiac contains little of his signature dark colour palette,
            gloomy urban settings, and disorienting camera angles. Instead, the
            film is a stylish and tense procedural told in a straightforward
            manner that evokes the classic paranoid “whodunits” of the 1970s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fincher continued to broaden his range, directing The Curious Case
            of Benjamin Button (2008), an adaptation of an F. Scott Fitzgerald
            short story about a man (played by Pitt) who ages backward. Although
            it was not as widely critically acclaimed as Zodiac, the film did
            earn Fincher his first Academy Award nomination for best director.
          </p>
          <p>
            He then helmed The Social Network (2010), a portrait of Facebook
            founder Mark Zuckerberg’s rise to power. The film was hailed by many
            critics as a 21st-century analogue to Citizen Kane, and Fincher won
            the best director Golden Globe and was nominated for an Academy
            Award.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fincher returned to a focus on sordid crime with The Girl with the
            Dragon Tattoo (2011), a sleek adaptation of Stieg Larsson’s
            best-selling novel about the investigation of an unsolved murder. He
            then served as an executive producer of the political drama House of
            Cards (2013–18), an episodic series that was created for Netflix and
            distributed via the company’s online streaming-video service.
            Fincher also directed the program’s first two hour-long episodes and
            won an Emmy Award for his work on the opening episode. He then
            directed a big-screen adaptation of author Gillian Flynn’s
            best-selling thriller novel Gone Girl (2014), about the mysterious
            circumstances surrounding a woman’s disappearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            His next project was the Netflix series Mindhunter (2017–19), about
            the first criminal profilers at the FBI; Fincher directed several
            episodes of the show and served as executive producer. He then
            helmed Mank (2020), a biopic about Herman Mankiewicz and his
            struggles to write the screenplay for Orson Welles’s classic Citizen
            Kane. The movie earned critical acclaim, and Fincher received his
            third Oscar nomination for best director.

              <p>
                On the day that Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans, elderly
                Daisy Williams (nee Fuller) is on her deathbed in a New Orleans
                hospital. At her side is her adult daughter, Caroline. Daisy
                asks Caroline to read to her aloud the diary of Daisy's lifelong
                friend, Benjamin Button. Benjamin's diary recounts his entire
                extraordinary life, the primary unusual aspect of which was his
                aging backwards, being diagnosed with several aging diseases at
                birth and thus given little chance of survival, but who does
                survive and gets younger with time. Abandoned by his biological
                father, Thomas Button, after Benjamin's biological mother died
                in childbirth, Benjamin was raised by Queenie, a black woman and
                caregiver at a seniors home. Daisy's grandmother was a resident
                at that home, which is where she first met Benjamin. Although
                separated through the years, Daisy and Benjamin remain in
                contact throughout their lives, reconnecting in their forties
                when in age they finally match up. Some of the revelations in
                Benjamin's diary are difficult for Caroline to read, especially
                as it relates to the time past this reconnection between
                Benjamin and Daisy, when Daisy gets older and Benjamin grows
                younger into his childhood years.

                Mikael Blomkvist is a disgraced journalist who is asked by a
                wealthy industrialist to write a biography on his family. But
                what he really wants Blomkvist to do is to find out what
                happened to his niece, who went missing 40 years ago. At first
                Blomkvist isn't interested, until the man offers to help him
                clear his name. Blomkvist begins by talking to the man's
                relatives who were there when the girl went missing, but some of
                them are not forthcoming. Blomkvist eventually believes that her
                disappearance might have something to do with some serial
                killings that took place 20 years before she disappeared, so he
                asks for a research assistant. The industrialist's man suggests
                Lisbeth Salander, a talented hacker who does background checks
                for them and who even did one on Blomkvist. When he sees her
                report, he's impressed and asks her to work with him and she
                does. She's anti-social but is extremely efficient.

                In 1940, film studio RKO 1940 hires 24-year-old wunderkind Orson
                Welles under a contract that gives him full creative control of
                his movies. For his first film, he calls in washed-up alcoholic
                Herman J. Mankiewicz to write the screenplay. That film is
                "Citizen Kane," and this is the story of how it was written.

                Nicholas Van Orton is a very wealthy San Francisco banker, but
                he is an absolute loner, even spending his birthday alone. In
                the year of his 48th birthday (the age his father committed
                suicide) his brother Conrad, who has gone long ago and
                surrendered to addictions of all kinds, suddenly returns and
                gives Nicholas a card giving him entry to unusual entertainment
                provided by something called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).
                Giving in to curiosity, Nicholas visits CRS and all kinds of
                weird and bad things start to happen to him.

                A serial killer in the San Francisco Bay Area taunts police with
                his letters and cryptic messages. We follow the investigators
                and reporters in this lightly fictionalized account of the true
                1970's case as they search for the murderer, becoming obsessed
                with the case. Based on Robert Graysmith's book, the movie's
                focus is the lives and careers of the detectives and newspaper
                people.

                A film about two homicide detectives' (Morgan Freeman and Brad
                Pitt) desperate hunt for a serial killer who justifies his
                crimes as absolution for the world's ignorance of the Seven
                Deadly Sins. The movie takes us from the tortured remains of one
                victim to the next as the sociopathic "John Doe" (Kevin Spacey)
                sermonizes to Detectives Somerset and Mills -- one sin at a
                time. The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer's
                terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and
                subdued tones characteristic of film noir. The seasoned and
                cultured but jaded Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in
                an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi while the
                bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at
                his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...

                On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer
                programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and
                heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and
                programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global
                social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six
                years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the
                youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur,
                success leads to both personal and legal complications.
